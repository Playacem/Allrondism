Allrondism crashes every time?  Have a suggestion?  Found a bug?  Create an issue now!

1. Please, please don't make any frivolous issues!  If it's a crash, try asking the people in IRC or MCF before creating an issue.  If it's a bug/suggestion, make sure it hasn't been reported/suggested already.  Thanks! :smile:
